This is a project about how to detect finger with a given hand's contour, and use it in gesture recognition.

In my Project, a hand is present on a black background, the program will find the hand contour and detect how many and the position of the finger tips. After finish that, I use it in the next program, where I use 1 finger to point, and it'll tell the direction (up, right, left, down)
.

This project is written in C++, using the OpenCV library. The code in compile and work well on Ubuntu on PC and Angstrom distro on my Beagleboard(with some config). However, it can be compiled but somehow crashed on Window.
